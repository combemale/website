I am involving into the following software projects:

- [The GEMOC Studio](http://gemoc.org/studio), a language workbench for language executability, assembling and globalization. The GEMOC Studio includes, among others: 
	- [Action Language for EMF (ALE)](http://gemoc.org/ale-lang/), to make Ecore metamodels executable.
	- [Sirius Animator](https://github.com/SiriusLab/ModelDebugging), to bring execution, debug and simulation in domain specific tooling built with EMF.
	- [Model of Concurrency and Communication Modeling Language (MoCCML)](https://github.com/gemoc/concurrency), to reify a formal model of concurrency in executable modeling languages.
	- [Behavioral Coordination Operator Language (BCOoL)](https://github.com/gemoc/coordination), to explicitly specify coordination patterns between heterogeneous languages.
- [Melange](http://melange-lang.org/), a language and platform for assembling and integrating multiple domain-specific languages (DSL)
- [Kermeta](http://kermeta.org/), an executable metamodeling language
- [Kompren](https://github.com/arnobl/kompren/wiki), a generic approach for model slicing



In the past, I involved in:

- [Topcased](https://www.polarsys.org/topcased) simulation tools
- [COQ4MDE](http://coq4mde.enseeiht.fr/FormalMDE/), a formal metamodeling framework based on COQ
