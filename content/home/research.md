My research activities lie inÂ <strong>Software and Systems Engineering</strong>, focusing on <strong>agility and safety</strong> within the development of <strong>software-intensive systems</strong>. 
In our group, <strong>we develop techniques, frameworks, and environments to facilitate the creation, integration, and automated processing of software languages</strong>. The main application domains include cyber-physical systems, Internet of things, embedded systems, smart technologies and sustainability systems.

In particular, we contribute to the following fields:
<ul>
	<li>Model-Driven (software and systems) Engineering, Software Language Engineering, Generative approaches</li>
	<li>Domain Specific (Modeling) Languages, and Metamodeling</li>
	<li>Software variability, and dynamic adaptive systems</li>
	<li>Aspect-oriented modeling and model composition</li>
	<li>Model Validation &amp; Verification</li>
	<li>Resilience Engineering, and DevOps</li>
	<li>Software Development Process &amp; Business Process Management</li>
</ul>
